# Bulldozer Price Prediction

This 'Bulldozer Price Prediction' is a regression project I made during my Complete AI and ML Bootcamp by ZTM. This is a time series dataset.

I completed this project along Daniel Bourke Sir and learnt a lot from it.

## Steps I followed:-

1. **Problem Definition** - Predicting whether the price of a bulldozer given the features.
2. **Data** - Downloaded and imported the data into a DataFrame.
3. **Evaluation** - Defined the evaluation metric i.e >95% RMSLE score.
4. **Features** - Defined a data dictionary which defines what a feature means.

5. **Modelling** - This includes
   * Splitting data into features and labels
   * Splitting the features and labels into train and test splits
   * Choosing the right model/s
   * Instantiating a model
   * Fitting the model/s
   * Evaluating the model
   * Choosing the model with best performance
   * Hyperparameter tuning for better performance of model
   * Evaluation report at the end


After the features section, we import all the necessary libraries, get the data ready and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to learn more about the data.

## What I learnt from this project?

* I learnt how I should get ready to make an ML project.
* Since this is a time series dataset, I learnt to parse dates.
* Perform Feature engineering on the dates column.
* Convert strings to categorical.
* Impute numeric columns then categorical columns
* Fill and turn categorical columns into numbers.
* Build a custom evaluation function.
* I learnt how to communicate better using markdowns in the notebooks.
* How to perform hyperparameter tuning
* How to evaluate my model using cross validation
* Also, how to google or use stack overflow in case you come across any error, which is one of the most important thing while making project.
and many more..

But these were the key takeaways while making this project.

I'm making new projects using this workflow I learnt and the workflow is not fixed and varies from person to person.
